Glider Launch
designed mainly for decent from tall buildings place close to edge of a building roof with a clear run for take off. 

Controls
Press E to mount glider and the glider takes off ....

When airbourne C becomes tilt forward and spacebar is tiltback... Whilst airbourne you can let go of W and use the
A and D controlss (strafe) and mouse to steer down to earth.... or for sustaining longer flights you need to
use the spacebar to tiltback to maintain height for as long as you can. 


When landing press E to dismount near desired landing position ... and then pickup the glider for your next adventure.

The Glider is craftable in a standard workbench with no progression needed as this is something you could make in early game at
the cost of resources and actually finding a working workbench.  Finding a workbench in early game would be a bonus and allow you
to make the Glider a lot sooner. The recipe is simple and uses in game resources.
